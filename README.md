# gradecalc

gradecalc is a basic utility written in rust designed to calculate and make speculations instead of tediously calculating grade averages.

Note that this program is highly susceptible to bugs (not fully tested), so please note of this before installing.

# Installation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/junikimm717/gradecalc.git
cd gradecalc
sudo make install
```

Note that gradecalc is, by default, stored in the /usr/local/bin directory.
Change this in the Makefile if you wish to install gradecalc in another
directory.
